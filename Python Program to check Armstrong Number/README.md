Armstrong Numbers

In number theory, a narcissistic number (also known as a pluperfect digital invariant (PPDI), an Armstrong number (after Michael F. Armstrong) or a plus perfect number) is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Given a number x, determine whether the given number is Armstrong number or not. A positive integer of n digits is called an Armstrong number of order n (order is number of digits) if.

The Armstrong number is also known as narcissistic number
